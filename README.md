###Probabilistic parsing

1. Download NLTK, install the fragment of PTB-II treebank available in NLTK. Reserve 10% of the sentences for testing and use the remaining 90% for learning.
2. Write a program to read the corpus. Provide auxiliary functions for facilitating the management of the trees. I suggest to use the tree class provided by NLTK.
3. Build a treebank grammar for performing chunking of nominal phrases (NP),
4. Transform the treebank grammar into a probabilistic one using counts in the corpus.
5. Test your chunker against the test corpus.
